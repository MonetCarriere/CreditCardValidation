# CreditCardValidation

This is a glassmorphisim styled UI for a credit card interface.

There was very little javascript involved in this. When the user goes to type their credit card info in, you will be able to see the credit card type 
(i.e... Visa, MasterCard, Discovery, e.t.c...).

I acheived this using the the Cleave.js API. I used their CDN to access the cleave library. This library allowed me to effortlessly implement the formating for the Credit Card Number, Expiration Date and CVV.
